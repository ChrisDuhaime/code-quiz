4th Homework Assignment Code Quiz

## Summary of Code Quiz assignment

 On this assignment we had to build a code quiz from scratch with no starter code.  I utilized 2 different html pages and 2 JavaScript files linked accordingly.  I built 2 primitive html pages and chose to create most of the quiz using JS.  I dynamically printed out the html tags using JS.  I was able to practice using multiple functions and playing around with the scope of many variables.  I had to change the scope several times to make this work. I was able to achieve all the requirements as far as I could tell.  I had a link in my header that always linked to index2 the "high scores" page as well as being redirected automatically at the end of game functions.  The timer starts when the game starts and 10 seconds is subtracted when a wrong answer is chosen.  I have it set so that they have to get the right answer to move on to the next question.  The scores are all saved on the browser and able to be recalled in index2/JS2.  The clear scores button also clears the local.storage to refresh on demand.
